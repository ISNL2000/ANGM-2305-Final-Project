## Description
Simple platformer game where the player must reach a certain point. The main objective of this project was to get the game functioning at a basic level without any major glitches or performance issues. While that was accomplished, there were several features from the proposal, like enemies and shooting, that were not included due to time constraints and my inexperience with the engine. Future improvements or features would be to implement these proposed features and to polish the game's visuals.



## Game Objective
Navigate a simple obstacle course to get to the goal. You win once you collide with the goal object.
